pid-challenge
---
Students in programming team are recommended to at least attempt the PID challenge. We'll go over the solution after kickoff. Before you begin, we recommend you to know basic python(conditionals, loops, functions, classes), git, and jupyter notebooks.

try it out!
---
the PID challenge is run in Jupyter notebooks. To try it out:

 0. Make sure you've installed python and jupyter
  - I've used [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) for this, but 3.6 should work fine
  - [install jupyter using pip](https://jupyter.org/install)
 1. Create a github account and download a [git client](https://github.com/pumatech-robotics/pid-challenge.git)
 2. fork this repository
 3. clone your forked repo to your computer
  - open a terminal/cmd prompt then copy/paste ```git clone [link to your forked repo, remove brackets]```
 4. try it out [(PIDChallenge.ipynb)](PIDChallenge.ipynb)
 5. push your changes to your fork so we can see the submissions!
 6. Email us at [pinnaclefrc@gmail.com](pinnaclefrc@gmail.com)

 The challenge is pretty difficult, so don't get discouraged if you can't complete it. We just need to see where you are in terms of programming skill/experience. You'll see the solution during our next meeting(probably).

    - ```pip install jupyter```
    - open terminal/cmd and go to desired directory
    - type ``` jupyter notebook``` in terminal/cmd and wait for environment to pop up in a browser
    - ```shift+enter``` to run code from a cell
        - make sure you've already run previous cells
    - ```kernel -> "restart and run all"``` if jupyter is acting weird
